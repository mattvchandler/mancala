Rules of the Game (from wikipedia - see link above)

1   At the beginning of the game, four beads are placed in each bowl.
2   Each player controls the six bowls and their beads on his side of the board.
    His score is the number of beads in the store to his right.
3   Players take turns sowing their beads. On a turn, the player removes all
    beads from one of the bowls under his control. Moving counter-clockwise, the
    player drops one bead in each bowl in turn, including the player's own store
    but not his opponent's.
4   If the last sown bead lands in the player's store, the player gets an
    additional move. There is no limit on the number of moves a player can make
    in his turn.
5   If the last sown bead lands in an empty bowl owned by the player, and the
    opposite bowl contains beads, both the last bead and the opposite beads are
    captured and placed into the player's store.
6   When one player no longer has any beads in any of his bowls, the game ends.
    The other player moves all remaining beads to his store, and the player with
    the most beads in his store wins.


To play:
    Click the bowl you wish to move from. Press the hint button for a hint.
    Board layout, AI settings, and rules may be changed in the settings dialog.
    Be warned that setting the board size too large and the AI depth too high
    will make the AI player and hint feature take a very long time to complete.
    2 GUI modes are available: a full, graphic-based GUI and a simple 
    button-based GUI (ideal for work environments). The mode may be changed at
    any time from the Display menu or chosen from the settings dialog.
